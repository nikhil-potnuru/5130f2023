In this week of progress, there are couple of things that I felt proud of, because they are kind of tough parts of the website. One is linking the database to the website and creating page for login and signup including the validation is a pretty hard task. The second one that I felt proud of is functioning the calculator which is the main heart of our website. Collecting all the variables, features and aspects & figuring out to write a function for calculator is also one of the hard task. The calculator function is not ready yet. We are still working on it to make it as a perfect, zero vulnerability function.
