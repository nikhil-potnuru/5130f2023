In this week we completed the login and signup page along with the validation.
And added some financial calculations to our calculator.
The page is connected to database(Mysql). And the data is being stored in the back end .
I also included the screenshots and also used the password verify function and stored the hash function generated password in db.

And below is my server link to acesss the page .
> http://18.224.151.89/

I hosted my page and database in AWS server.

Thanks, for questions and queries :
